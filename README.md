In October 2024, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rl3z0wn27o) how the wellbeing of children and young people was at risk from cuts to local services, according to a warning from the Children’s Commissioner.

Our analysis showed local authorities were making £3bn in savings that financial year, but still faced a funding shortfall of more than £5.7bn by 2026-27.

Local government experts said councils had carried out "all of the easy cuts" years ago and were now struggling to protect vital children's and adult social care services.

Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza (pictured above) said: "Children must not pay the price for balancing budgets."

Local government minister Jim McMahon said the new government had inherited a crisis and there was "no shying away" from the scale of it.
